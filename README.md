# Task Board App

## Description
A simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I built it with the intention to provide users with an app that has the functionality to keep track of their tasks. This app allows users to input a task along with the deadline and helps them keep track of each task's progress towards completion. By building this project I learned that it's important in life as well as in software development to be organized and break down tasks in small parts in order to tackle larger projects.
